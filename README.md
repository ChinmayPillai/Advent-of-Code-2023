## Overview
Great problems and filled with lots of learnings.

The problems started with easy logic based questions for the first few days, then went onto **Graph + Memoization** based questions. Following this we had a few **Dynamic Programming** based questions and one **Dijkstra's Algorithm** implementation. As we approached the last week, we got back to **Graph** based questions and finally ended with very **logic and math** heavy questions.

It was a great experience for me and I would recommend everyone interested in programming to participate next year. Looking forward to Advent of Code 2024.
